# Gun Art Online (GAO)

These are the scripts used in the game. Due to size and assets used in the game, the whole project could not be uploaded here.

The Manager part of the scripts should  never the less be modular enough to be used in other games.
It provides basic functionalities like joystick configurations and auto save.
The manager uses the singleton/persistent pattern, making it ideal place to store temporary session data.
